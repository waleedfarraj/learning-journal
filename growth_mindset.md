# ***THE Growth mindset***
## A new hip term you might of heard about somewhere lately but what does it **MEAN**!

The growth mindset is the belief that your limits are not set in stone 
Like a marble statue that will only decay by time it is like a plant that 
Will grow and be fruitful if you take care of it  or will shrivel up and 
die if ignored .

### here i am going to include 3 reminders to my self to avoid fixed mindset blocks 

1. When in doubt remind yourself by times you actually said I can't do  it but you have done it this time is no different.
1. Nothing worth having or doing is  ***easy***  when it is hard to get or do that is what is worth doing.
1. Everything you are feeling now  will eventually subside and you can avoid the un-comfort for the moment by quitting but you will feel it later in regret so just go through it the right way there is no easy way in life .
