# ***THE Growth mindset***
## A new hip term you might of heared about somewhere lately but what does it **MEAN** !

The growth mindset is the belief that your limits are not set in stone 
like a marble statue that will only decay by time it is like a plant that 
will grow and be fruitfull if you take care of it  or will shrivel up and 
die if ignored .

### here i am going to include 3 reminders to my self to avoid fixed mindset blocks 

1. When in doubt remind yourself by times you actually said i can't do  it but you have done it this time is no diffrent.
1. Nothing worth having or doing is  ***easy***  when it is hard to get or do that is what is worth doing.
1. Every thing you are feeling now  will evantually subside and you can avoid the uncomfort for the moment by quiting but you will feel it later in regret so just go through it the right way there is no easy way in life .
