1. ACCESS CONTENT 
You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example: 
    - Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page 
    - Select any elements that have a c 1 ass attribute with a value of note 
    - Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of ema i 1 
1. MODIFY CONTENT 
You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example: 
    - Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element 
    - Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements 
    - Change the size or position of an <i mg> element 
1. PROGRAM RULES 
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example: 
    - A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image. 
    - A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments. 
    - An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport). 

1. REACT TO EVENTS 
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when: 
     - A button is pressed 
     - A link is clicked (or tapped) on 
     - A cursor hovers over an element 
     - Information is added to a form  
     - An interval of time has passed 
     - A web page has finished loading 
   
   ### HOW to create scripts!
   To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
   Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 
   1. Define your goal 
   1. Design the script
   1. Code each part 
 
  ### EXPRESSIONS 
  An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
